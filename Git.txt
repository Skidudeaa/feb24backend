Git Tutorial


 1 Starting your work: Open your files and work on your project just like you normally would.                                                                     
   2 Saving your work: Once you've made some changes that you would like to save, you'll do the following in your Terminal or Command Prompt:                       
      • Navigate into your project's directory using the cd (change directory) command.                                                                             
      • Type git status. This will show you what files have been changed.                                                                                           
      • Type git add . This adds all changed files to the staging area. If you only want to add some files, you can replace . with the filename(s).                 
      • Type git commit -m "Short message describing what changes you made". This creates a save point or snapshot of your current files.                           
                                                                                                                                                                    
  Now your work is saved locally on your computer in Git. You can repeat these steps whenever you've made changes that you want to save.                            
                                                                                                                                                                    
   3 Backing up your work on GitHub: To save your work in the GitHub cloud (like a backup of your saves), take these additional steps:                              
   • Type git push. This will push your saved snapshots to GitHub.
