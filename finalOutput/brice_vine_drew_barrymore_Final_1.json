The name of the song comes from the actress who Bryce Vine first saw in The Wedding Singer and was someone who he thought represented all the qualities he would want in a significant other. In the song Bryce talks about how he loves this girl for who she is and how they make him feel which is one of the most important qualities for him in a significant other. The song also features pop culture references to famous couples who loved each other for who they were such as Bonnie and Clyde, a criminal couple who travelled the US during the Great Depression and became known for their bank robberies, as well as Harrelson and Juliette, lead actors from the 1994 crime film, Natural Born Killers, who portray two psychotic killers who travel around the US and fall in love because they are so similar. The song peaked at 46th on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 2018 and was later released as part of Bryce\u2019s debut album in 2019, Carnival.", "bgColor": "aabed6", "textColors": {"textColor1": "0d0c0a", "textColor2": "342619", "textColor3": "2d3033", "textColor4": "4c443f"}, "songDuration": 191100, "lyrics_with_timestamps": [{"id": "47cbaa23-473c-423e-a46a-e416e4772264", "lyric": "\u4f5c\u8bcd : Julia Michaels/Nolan Lambroza/JP Clark/Bryce Christopher Ross Johnson", "timestamp": 0.0}, {"id": "b1f8a001-1a6f-4d0a-b8fd-1f7db0e1d37b", "lyric": "\u4f5c\u66f2 : Julia Michaels/Nolan Lambroza/JP Clark/Bryce Christopher Ross Johnson", "timestamp": 1.0}], "annotations_with_timestamps": []}
