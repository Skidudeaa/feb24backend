Featuring Juice\u2019s usual topics of drugs and glamour with fashion, he sings about his anxiety and his corruption when it comes to addiction. The song leaked online in late 2019, but was later released by Juice\u2019s label, Grade A Productions, on April 24, 2020, four months after Juice unexpectedly passed away following a seizure at Chicago\u2019s Midway Airport. Even before the leak, Juice and his team had previewed the song several times on Instagram Live, with Juice teasing and titling the song in the summer of 2019. One day prior the release, Juice\u2019s fianc\u00e9 posted on Twitter explaining what the song meant to her.", "bgColor": "fdfeff", "textColors": {"textColor1": "141414", "textColor2": "3a2c21",
