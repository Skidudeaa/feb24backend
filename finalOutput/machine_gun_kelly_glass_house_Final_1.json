The song leaked ahead of the album\u2019s release, but it was not known whose vocals it contained. Many people thought that the vocals belong to Lana Del Rey, because MGK teased in October 2018 the song was recorded with her for the coming album. However, MGK said that that album was deleted, and instead MGK made Hotel Diablo.", "bgColor": "101010", "textColors": {"textColor1": "cddacc", "textColor2": "cbc1a6", "textColor3": "a7b1a6",
