{"title": "Paranoid", "artist": "Post Malone", "album": "beerbongs & bentleys", "release_date": "2018-04-27", "description": "\u201cParanoid\u201d is the opening track to Post Malone\u2019s long-awaited beerbongs & bentleys. Post details his doubts about his security and safety with his friends and his rise to fame. He feels as if people could be manipulating him for his fame and fortune and begins taking more precautions to protect himself. During his 2021 Rolling Loud performance, Post said that the song\u2019s inspiration comes from losing trust in one of his closest friends within the music industry. Further details about who this is in reference to are unclear. This song could also be influenced by the 2017 controversy in which infamous YouTuber, Jake Paul, uploaded a since-deleted video that initially contained footage of Post Malone\u2019s private property after seeing his interview with H3H3 Productions in which Post criticized Paul\u2019s single, \u201cIt\u2019s Everyday Bro\u201d, and then proceeded to purchase Paul\u2019s merch for an ironic joke soon after.", "bgColor": "f2f0f1", "textColors": {"textColor1": "121210", "textColor2": "151514", "textColor3": "3e3e3d", "textColor4": "414140"}, "songDuration": 221800, "lyrics_with_timestamps":
